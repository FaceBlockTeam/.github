FaceBlock Chain

Social Trust & Intent Verification Protocol

Building a decentralized trust layer for the AI era
— turning social intent into verifiable on-chain facts.

1. Problem
The Internet Has a Truth Crisis

In the age of AI-generated content, we face three structural problems:

No cost for false statements
Anyone can make claims, predictions, or promises with zero downside.

No native trust primitive
Platforms rely on centralized moderation or opaque reputation systems.

AI amplification
AI can mass-produce “intent-like” content faster than humans can verify.

This leads to:

Fake news and misinformation

Low-signal social media

Unreliable predictions and promises

No on-chain way to verify who said what, with real stake

2. Solution: FaceBlock Chain

FaceBlock Chain is a credit-based social blockchain that turns human intent into verifiable on-chain facts.

We introduce:

Intent-as-Asset
Statements, predictions, and commitments become on-chain objects.

Staked Truth
Every intent requires staking a credit index (“慧”), creating real cost for lies.

Federated Public Consensus
Truth is decided by communities of trust, not miners or validators-for-hire.

True intent earns rewards.
False intent has a cost.

3. Core Innovation
Staked Intent + Federated Consensus (SCP)

FaceBlock is built on Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), enabling:

Open membership (no permissioned validators)

Trust-based quorum slices

Fast, low-energy consensus

Natural resistance to centralization

This makes SCP uniquely suited for social truth and intent verification.

4. Why SCP (Not PoW / PoS)
Dimension	PoW / PoS	SCP (FaceBlock)
Trust Model	Capital / Hashpower	Social trust
Energy	High	Minimal
Governance	Centralizing	Federated
Latency	Seconds–minutes	Sub-second
Social Consensus	Poor fit	Native fit

Intent verification is not a mining problem.
It is a trust coordination problem.

SCP solves exactly that.

5. Market Opportunity
Target Markets

Social Media Trust Infrastructure

AI Content Verification

Prediction Markets

DeFi Intent & Commitment Verification

Reputation & Credit Protocols

Macro Tailwinds

Explosion of AI-generated content

Loss of trust in centralized platforms

Rise of on-chain social primitives

Demand for verifiable reputation systems

This is a new category, not a feature.

6. Competitive Moat
1. Protocol-Level Trust (Not Platform Rules)

Trust is enforced by cryptography + economics, not moderation teams.

2. SCP-Based Federation

No single validator set can capture the network.

3. Credit, Not Speculation

“慧” is a credit index, not a speculative token.

4. Composable Truth

Verified intents can be consumed by:

DeFi

Oracles

Insurance

AI agents

Governance systems

7. Current Status

Core protocol design completed

SCP-based consensus architecture validated

Prototype chain and tooling available

Small but focused technical community

Preparing next testnet phase

We are early — by design.

8. Vision

FaceBlock aims to become:

The trust layer for human intent in the AI age

Where:

Truth has a cost

Lies have consequences

Reputation is portable and verifiable

AI systems can reason over human credibility

9. Funding

FaceBlock Chain is actively fundraising to accelerate:

Protocol engineering

Testnet expansion

Ecosystem integrations

Research on AI + social consensus

We are looking for long-term aligned partners, not hype capital.
